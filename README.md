### Checkers Game by Samuel Lelyukh

## Rules of Checkers

Please follow the instructions available here:

CHECKERS INSTRUCTIONS:
*   Select the piece you want to move, Open moves will appear as green circles.
*   To kill a piece, jump over it.
*   If a kill move is possible, you are forced to do it.
*   If a kill is possible after your kill, it is still your turn and you can make the next kill.
*   If you reach the opposite end of the board, your piece becomes a king which can move forward and backward.
*   Game continues until a player has run out of pieces.
*   Good Luck!
